📘 Algorithm & Problem Landscape – Solved vs Unsolved



A beautifully designed website that visualizes which major problems in Algorithms, Math, Cryptography, Physics, and AI are:

✔ Solved
⚠ Partially Solved (Approximate)
❌ Unsolved (Open Problems)
⭐ AI-Accelerated Breakthroughs

Includes category filtering + dark/light mode toggle + smooth UI.

🚀 Features

🟢 Filterable problems (Solved / Partial / Unsolved / AI-Accelerated)

🌙 Dark & Light mode toggle (with localStorage memory)

🎨 Modern, clean UI

📂 Proper separation of files (index.html, styles.css, script.js)

⚡ Fast, responsive layout

📚 Great for learning algorithms, CS theory, and open problems

📌 Purpose

This project gives a high-level map of the world's most important computational and mathematical problems — an excellent reference for:

Developers

CS students

Researchers

Curious learners

🛠️ Tech Stack

HTML5

CSS3 (custom design, gradients, shadows, theming)
